The best compliment I ever received was from my little brother: “My science
teacher’s unbelievably good at telling stories,” he announced. “Nearly as good
as you.” I thought about that, how I savor a good story the way some people
savor last-minute touchdowns.

I learned in biology that I’m composed of 7 × 10 27 atoms, but that number
didn’t mean anything to me until I read Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly
Everything. One sentence stayed with me for weeks: “Every atom you possess has
almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of
organisms on its way to becoming you.” It estimates that each human has about 2
billion atoms of Shakespeare hanging around inside—quite a comfort, as I try to
write this essay. I thought about every one of my atoms, wondering where they
had been and what miracles they had witnessed.

My physical body is a string of atoms, but what of my inner self, my soul, my
essence? I’ve come to the realization that my life has been a string as well, a
string of stories. Every one of us is made of star stuff, forged through fires,
and emerging as nicked as the surface of the moon. It frustrated me no end that
I couldn’t sit down with all the people I met, interrogating them about their
lives, identifying every last story that made them who they are.

I remember how magical it was the first time I read a fiction book: Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I was duly impressed with Quidditch and the
Invisibility Cloak, of course, but I was absolutely spellbound by how much I
could learn about Harry. The kippers he had for breakfast, the supplies he
bought for Potions—the details everyone skimmed over were remarkable to me.
Fiction was a revelation. Here, at last, was a window into another person’s
string of stories!

Over the years, I’ve thought long and hard about that immortal question: What
superpower would you choose? I considered the usual suspects—invisibility,
superhuman strength, flying—but threw them out immediately. My superhero alter
ego would be Story Girl. She wouldn’t run marathons, but she could walk for
miles and miles in other people’s shoes. She’d know that all it takes for
empathy and understanding is the right story.

Imagine my astonishment when I discovered Radiolab on NPR. Here was my imaginary
superpower, embodied in real life! I had been struggling with AP Biology, seeing
it as a class full of complicated processes and alien vocabulary. That changed
radically when I listened, enthralled, as Radiolab traced the effects of
dopamine on love and gambling. This was science, sure, but it was science as
I’d never heard it before. It contained conflict and emotion and a narrative;
it made me anxious to learn more. It wasn’t that I was obtuse for biology; I
just hadn’t found the stories in it before.

I’m convinced that you can learn anything in the form of a story. The layperson
often writes off concepts—entropy, the Maginot Line, anapestic meter—as too
foreign to comprehend. But with the right framing, the world suddenly becomes
an open book, enticing and ripe for exploration. I want to become a writer to
find those stories, much like Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich from Radiolab,
making intimidating subjects become familiar and inviting for everyone. I want
to become Story Girl.
